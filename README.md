## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/sails-adminpanel/sails-typescript).

The main idea behind this project is to achieve full TypeScript support for Sails. However, there are currently some challenges due to the need to use a starter and define everything globally within it. Efforts are underway to move towards a solution where only module renaming is required.

Additionally, there is a need for a pipeline to generate models, services, and helpers automatically. Contributions in these areas would greatly benefit the project and the Sails community as a whole.

Contributions of all kinds are welcome! Whether you're interested in improving typings, adding features, fixing bugs, or contributing to documentation, your input is valuable.

If you have any suggestions, find any issues, or have ideas for improvements, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/sails-adminpanel/sails-typescript).
